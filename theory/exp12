Experiment 12: Deploying a Website using Ansible and MySQL
Theory: Ansible, an infrastructure-as-code tool, uses playbooks (YAML files) to automate server setup, application deployment, and configuration tasks. Ansibleâ€™s modular approach supports components like MySQL modules for database provisioning, and web file deployment.

Key Components:

Ansible Modules: Small scripts for tasks like installing software.
Playbooks: Define the desired server state in YAML format, automating tasks like MySQL setup.
Procedure:

Write playbooks (mysqlmodule.yml for MySQL, deploywebsite.yml for website).
Run ansible-playbook commands to execute playbooks, set up the MySQL server, and deploy website files.
Test website functionality on the target machine.
Conclusion: We successfully used Ansible playbooks to deploy a website by configuring a MySQL database server and automating the code deployment.
