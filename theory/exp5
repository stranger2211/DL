Experiment 5: Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline with Tomcatâ€‹(exp5)
Theory:
In this experiment, we created and configured a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline in Jenkins to deploy an application on a Tomcat server. Jenkins pipelines automate the software lifecycle from building to testing and deploying the application.

Steps:

Configure Jenkins and integrate it with Git.
Set up a Jenkins pipeline to compile, test, and package the application into a .war file.
Install Tomcat server, configure Jenkins to deploy the .war file to Tomcat automatically.
The final step automates the deployment of the application onto the Tomcat server, ensuring smooth Continuous Deployment.
Conclusion:
This experiment demonstrated the creation of a Jenkins CI/CD pipeline to deploy a web application on a Tomcat server. We explored the stages of building, testing, and deploying applications in an automated workflow, showing how pipelines improve the software deployment process.
