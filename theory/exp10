Experiment 10: Ansible Installation on AWS Instances
Theory:
Ansible is a configuration management tool that automates software provisioning and application deployment. It operates via a Controller (Master) and Inventory (list of hosts to be managed). Using YAML-based playbooks, Ansible allows for flexible configuration across multiple nodes.

Commands Used:

Install Ansible: apt-get install ansible
Setup SSH: ssh-keygen -t rsa for secure key-based access
Run Playbook: ansible -m ping all to test connectivity
Conclusion:
This setup ensures automated deployment, reduces human error, and allows for consistent configurations across systemsâ€‹(exp10).
