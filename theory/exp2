Experiment 2: Git Installation and Repository Managementâ€‹(exp2)
Theory:
Git is a distributed version control system (VCS) used to track changes in source code during software development. It enables multiple developers to collaborate on the same project without conflicts. Git maintains a history of all changes, allowing rollback to previous versions when necessary. It supports both local and remote repositories, with GitHub being a popular hosting service for remote repositories.

Key commands:

git init: Initializes a new Git repository.
git add <file>: Stages a file for commit.
git commit -m "message": Commits the staged files to the repository with a message.
git push: Pushes the local commits to the remote repository.
git log: Displays the commit history.
Conclusion:
In this experiment, we successfully installed Git and managed a local and remote repository. We understood how to track changes, commit files, and push them to a remote repository like GitHub. Git ensures effective collaboration and version control in software development.
