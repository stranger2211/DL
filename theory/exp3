Experiment 3: Version Control with Git

Objective: Implement a version control system using Git.
Theory: Git, a distributed VCS, manages code versions and allows for easy tracking and collaboration. Common commands include git init, git add, git commit, git branch, and git merge.
Commands:
git init - Initializes a new Git repository.
git add <file> - Stages changes.
git commit -m "<message>" - Commits staged changes.
git branch <branch-name> - Creates a new branch.
git merge <branch-name> - Merges branches.
Conclusion: Gained insights on Git branching and merging, which facilitates collaborative developmentâ€‹(exp3).
